Hi! I'm Chittesh Sham, a DevOps engineer at #TeamCorel, welcome to my personal blog. I am a Linux enthusiast and in this blog you will find mostly systems related blogposts. I have a few personal interesting projects lined up, so I figured why not have a blog where I could have a sort of personal documentation on my path to learning.
