## Low level systems programming begineer's path (Zlang)

As many of you knows, I have been a Linux Systems Engineer for 3 years now and Ive recently joined Corel as a DevOps engineer. For the last couple of months I was looking for ways to develop myself as a professional and the answer that I got was just to nerd out and build fun cool projects. I've always been a more hands-on person because this is the way I get the most learning from. I have no prior programming experience, except a few python/bash/yml scripting, nothing fancy. Recently I have found myself being borderline obssesed about distributed systems.

Blockchain, a field that I have been avoiding since its inception due to the fact that hype stuffs turns me off, have been showing up on my searches more than once and as I mentioned being a hands-on person, I am planning to get the neccessary knowledge to build an mvp of a blockchain network. So step one was to find out a language where I could have both the performance and the security. Since Im not a coder, the language didn't matter only its potential did. I consulted a very experienced coder and friend of mine Renghen, he has used scala/kotlin/haskell/nim/zig/java/rust you name it. And we had an hour long talk about some recent local developments, I had my mind set on Rust but after explaining my project objectives, the pros and cons of numerous languages he finally convinced me on trying out Zig Lang.

So here I am, no coding experience, trying to learn Zig, I did some reasearch and stumbled upon a video from creator https://youtu.be/Gv2I7qTux7g and that was what sold me, basically he is trying to have a clone of C but without the crappy parts. I did'nt understand much of the code, but they have an indepth documentation and learning center @ https://ziglearn.org/ and https://ziglang.org/learn/

I shall be starting with Ziglings https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings, which are
