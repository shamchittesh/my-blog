      <description>Before you say anything about disgraceful or tasteless my choice of words are, i&amp;rsquo;d like to take a moment to say to you that - this is my blog, not yours! Go build your fucking own! Speaking of building blogs , here&amp;rsquo;s why and how I built mine.
Why? To have a repertoire of my learnings.
How? I wanted something I could build fast and deploy easily and free, something lightweight thats why I chose Hugo</description>
